#  Student Performance Data Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance data to identify key factors affecting academic scores. The goal is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

---

## Objective

* Analyze student marks in Math, Science, and English
* Identify relationships between study hours, attendance, and performance
* Detect outliers and missing values
* Generate actionable insights

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

* Student_ID
* Gender
* Study_Hours
* Attendance (%)
* Math_Score
* Science_Score
* English_Score

---

##  Data Cleaning Steps

* Checked for missing values
* Handled null values using mean/median
* Removed duplicate records
* Converted data types where necessary
* Detected outliers using IQR method

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Descriptive statistics using `df.describe()`
* Correlation analysis using heatmap
* Distribution plots for subject scores
* Boxplots to detect outliers
* Scatter plots to analyze study hours vs marks

---

##  Key Insights

* Students with higher study hours scored better in all subjects.
* Attendance has a positive correlation with total marks.
* Math and Science scores show strong correlation.
* Few outliers were detected in English scores.

---

##  Visualizations

The project includes:

* Heatmap for correlation
* Histogram for score distribution
* Boxplot for outlier detection
* Scatter plot for performance trends

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Study hours and attendance significantly impact student performance. Proper data cleaning and visualization help uncover meaningful academic trends.

---

##  Future Improvements

* Apply Machine Learning models to predict student performance
* Perform feature engineering
* Create dashboard using Power BI or Tableau
